This is Devops 

Learn how to get started with Release Management and its advantages. See how to create a build definition using CI/CD Tools for VSTS Extensions (I will be using Package Extension and Publish Artifact tasks), and also using DevOps-VSTS-POC trigger in order to enable CI, all of that in order to be able to publish, share, install and query versions. You will see how to create release definition, choose an artifact and configure source for the artifact and default version. See how to create different environments or clone the existing one, in my case I am going to create QA, Preproduction and Production environment, each with one phrase and one task. See also how to configure Publish Extension task for each environment See an end-to-end continuous delivery pipeline using VSTS extension with Build and Release Management.
